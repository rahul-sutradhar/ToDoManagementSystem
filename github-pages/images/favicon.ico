This is a placeholder for the ICO version of the favicon.
The actual ICO file should be generated from the SVG or PNG version.

To convert the SVG/PNG to ICO, you can use:
1. Online converters like https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
2. Image editing software like GIMP or Photoshop
3. Command line tools like ImageMagick

A proper favicon.ico file should include multiple sizes:
- 16x16 pixels
- 32x32 pixels
- 48x48 pixels
